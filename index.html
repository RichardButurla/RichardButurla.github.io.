        <p>This is my first post. I have been studying programming in college and its great! I find it super fun and interesting. We have done C++ mostly but now we have got to learn HTML! I have used HTML before. But ive never gone in-depth or used khan academy to learn and go along with it.</p>
        
        <h4 id="cexp">My experience with C++</h4>
        <p> I've been having lots of fun with c++. I love messing around with it and trying to see what i can change or how i can do something. Ive been doing well in the module, and i hope that for my Christmas interactive project i can make a really cool game! </p>
        
        <h4 id="htmlexp">My experience with HTML</h4>
        <p> I have only been learning HTML for about 3 weeks now. Its not as fun as C++ but i hope I'm wrong about that. I enjoy mostly using CSS rather than the html itself because i like to see color and cool styles rather than just structure and type out paragraphs like I'm doing right now...
